Currently working at <a href='https://payfit.com' class='link' target='_blank'>Payfit</a> for my apprenticeship, I'm evolving as software engineer there surrounded by talented humans.</p><p>Last year, I live the best internship ever during 6 months at <a href='https://fictivekin.com' class='link' target='_blank'>Fictive Kin</a>, a digital studio based in Brooklyn. New York experience was incredible, I worked with great people, visited this amazing city, and I'm looking forward to come back one day.</p><p>Next January, I’ll end my student life and I'm going to look for new opportunities, in France, Europe or wherever life takes me. So I'll be happy to chat with you for any kind of projects :-).</p>"
