Until December 2019, I'm doing my internship at <a href='https://fictivekin.com' class='link' alt='FK website' target='_blank'>Fictive Kin</a>, a digital studio based in Brooklyn. So far, my experience in New York City is incredible. I could not be more happy to work with great people in this amazing city. I’ve been able to improve myself professionally but also personally.</p><p>Last year I decided to do my internship in Amsterdam where I worked for <a href='https://superherocheesecake.com' class='link' alt='Superherocheesecake website' target='_blank'>Superhero Cheesecake</a> as a Creative Developer intern for 4 months. Working with talented people helped me to improve a lot of my skills, and it made this internship unique.</p><p><b>Next January, I’ll start my 5th and last year at HETIC and I’m looking for an apprenticeship from January to December 2019 in Paris. I'll be happy to chat with you for any opportunities, so feel free to reach me if you are interested :-).</b></p>"
